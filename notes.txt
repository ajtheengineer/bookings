# User stories for leaving reviews

1. User can see all the ratings under the places detail page
2. User can leave rating where they enter: 
  - Name
  - Rating (0 and 5)
  - Leave a comment
3. User can see the average rating at the top of the detail screen
4. User can see the average rating within the list view

Backend Responsibilities
- Storing all the reviews that users have left
- Surfacing such data to the front end

Frontend

# Detail page.
Front end is going to get all the reviews for a place by
making a request to the following endpoint.
```
GET /api/places/<id>/reviews
```

When backend returns the data to the front end, 
the front end will show tall the reviews in a list.

Step 1: Defining the table in which we would store the reviews.
